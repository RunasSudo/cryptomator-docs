Error Handling
=============

Enhancing error management and facilitating problem resolution, we offer you the option to access our up-to-date error database. The error database is hosted on our server, so all requests are directed exclusively to it. Without your explicit consent, no requests will be executed, as this feature operates solely on an Opt-In basis.

Simply click the ``Look up Solution`` button.

We will cross-reference your current error with the database and provide a solution link if one is available.

If no results are found, you can initiate your own search by selecting ``Look up this error`` or create a ticket by selecting ``Report this error``.
