Install Cryptomator on Linux
----------------------------

Cryptomator is available on Linux via ``Flatpak``, ``PPA`` and ``AUR`` package managers, and as an AppImage (an ``.appimage`` file).

The easiest and recommended way of installing Cryptomator on Linux is by downloading Cryptomator's AppImage (an ``.appimage`` file) - as it works on almost all distrubtions. 
Just remember to `make it executable <https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/run-appimages.html#running-appimages>`_ before you try to run it.
