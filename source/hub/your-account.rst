First Login
-----------

The very first time you log in to Cryptomator Hub, you're asked to set up your account.
This is a one-time process that takes just a minute.

In the setup your private *Account Key* is generated and displayed.
Your account key is used for trusting browsers or apps connecting to Hub, it is not used for encrypting vault data.
We recommend to copy your account key to a secure place (e.g. password manager), but you can always view it later in your profile from any trusted browser.
If you lose your account key, you can reset it.

The browser used for the setup is automatically trusted.
You can revoke the trust at any time in your profile.

After storing your account key securely, tick the checkbox and finish the setup.
You are now logged in to Hub and can start using it.
